          </div>
          <div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
            Speedrunning is the art of completing a video game as quickly as
            possible, often using optimized strategies, glitches, and
            exceptional skill to achieve record-breaking times. Speedrunning
            isn’t just about rushing through a game; it’s a challenge against
            the clock, the game, and even the boundaries of what’s thought
            possible. It’s about deep mastery, creative problem-solving, and
            innovation, all within the context of beloved video games.

            UNDERSTANDING SPEEDRUNNING
          </div>
          <p className="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
            Speedrunning is incredibly diverse, with categories for every type
            of player and game. Each game has its own set of rules and
            categories that challenge runners in unique ways. Two popular
            category types include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside max-w-5xl mx-auto">
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>Any%</strong> The goal is to finish the game as fast as
              possible, using any tricks, skips, or glitches allowed.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>100%</strong> Players must complete every task or collect
              every item, making it a more comprehensive and often lengthier
              challenge.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="max-w-5xl mx-auto mt-5">
            Below are two examples of category trees, showcasing how games
            differ in structure and speedrunning possibilities. Hover over the
            nodes to see the rules of the corresponding category (if they are
            defined on speedrun.com).
          </p>
          <div className="mx-auto w-full mt-5">

              In <strong>Minecraft: Java Edition</strong>, the tree has a
              relatively simple shape, as the game is not divided into levels.
              Its categories focus on goals like defeating the Ender Dragon as
              fast as possible. Since there are no per-level runs, the tree is
              straightforward compared to other games.
            </p>

            <p className="max-w-5xl mx-auto mb-9">
              In contrast, <strong>Portal</strong> has a much more complex
              category tree. The game features both full-game and per-level
              categories, which greatly expand its scope for speedrunners. While
              per-level runs offer fascinating insights into specific parts of
              the game, they were excluded from this analysis due to the sheer
              volume of data they would introduce.

            These examples highlight the endless variety of speedrunning
            category trees, as every game presents unique challenges, rules, and
            opportunities for creativity. Whether a game is open-ended like
            Minecraft or structured like Portal, the diversity in speedrunning
            reflects the ingenuity of its community.

            Speedrunning is a global phenomenon, with players from around the
            world competing for top times. But which countries are the most
            competitive? To answer this question, we created a scoring system
            based on the positions of runners on the leaderboards.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
            For each run, the position of the runner at the time of submission
            determines the score they contribute to their country. The scoring
            system assigns points as follows:
